    <h2>SENTENCE AUTO COMPLETION</h2>
    <p>
      In the world of today, the technology development led to the increase in
      number of texting applications. In order to build a conversation with
      anyone sending a text is one of the way. It includes sending a message,
      writing an email or searching anything in the search engine. The main goal
      of the project is to build auto complete system in text processing.
      Auto-complete systems are recurrent in the daily use of mobiles or PCs
      while generating a text. Every time you type a message in the text box,
      you will often find suggestions to help you to complete the sentence. The
      suggestions will be based on most frequently typed messages. The core of
      the system will involve using pre-trained language models such as learning
      it with large datasets of text messages or conversations to understand the
      user writing patterns. This model will continuously analyze the text input
      and predict the next word based on evolving context of the sentence and
      also spell checks a particular word and suggest the correct spell of that
      word. We are going to implement it with python programming language and
      nlp methods like N-Gram model and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory).
