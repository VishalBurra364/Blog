    <h2>SALES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
    <p>Sales prediction is a critical component of business strategy, allowing companies to predict future sales trends and make data driven decisions.
        Machine learning techniques are emerged as powerful tools for predicting sales figures accurately.
        The goal is to create precise models that using data from the past can anticipate future sales.
        Here we make use of machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
        We need to take dataset of the past sales information of the several products and apply it on the algorithms to predict future sales.
